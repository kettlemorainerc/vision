# Starting
If you use intellij you can use the internal terminal and run `git update-index --assume-unchanged VIDEO_DATA/*`
to prevent arbitrary updates that mean nothing from being caught by git.

In order to start you will want to run the `run` task. It should set everything up.

## run
should be under the "application" tasks group in the IntelliJ Gradle menu.

Otherwise you can run the terminal commands. Depending on the terminal either `./gradlew run` or `gradlew run` should work.

## Dep Jars

Various external dependencies may need to be pulled from the following locations
