As of starting the project in order to successfully run you must run two separate processes, one utilizing

video.Main aimingFEThree2020
vision.NTMain aimingFEThree2020

# Starting
You will need to run vision once before attempting anything. If you use intellij you can use the internal terminal and run 
`git update-index --assume-unchanged VIDEO_DATA/*` to prevent arbitrary updates that mean nothing from being caught by git.

After starting, and closing, vision once your local files should be setup in such a way to be used with the application as a whole.
In order to start you will want to run the `startNetwork` gradle command. Either through the intellij Gradle menu, or by running one of the following in the terminal: `./gradlew startNetwork` or `gradlew startNetwork`.

Once that has started up you should see some message starting with something similar to `NT: client:`.

After that has starting you're free start up the vision be running the `run` task instead of the `startNetwork` task.

## startNetwork
should be under the "other' tasks group in the IntelliJ Gradle menu.

Otherwise you can run terminal commands. Depending on the terminal either `./gradlew startNetwork` or `gradlew startNetwork` should work.

## run
should be under the "application" tasks group in the IntelliJ Gradle menu.

Otherwise you can run the terminal commands. Depending on the terminal either `./gradlew run` or `gradlew run` should work.
